    <h1 id= "title"><u>FDM 3D Printing</u></h1>
    <p id= "firstparagraph">FDM 3d printing is the process of constructing a three dimensional 
        object from a 3d model. This is being done by slowly depositing tiny layers of plastic 
        from a filament spool, such process allows the person owning the printer to design a part
        and print it within a few hours, allowing to produce prototypes of many mechanical/art/robotics 
        designs at very attractive costs, combining with the lighting speed prototyping capabilities a 
        printer unlocks, it becomes a very usefull tool for pretty much everyone, wether youre a large
        company or a hobbyist however- as for everything, a FDM printer has its own set of 
        disadvantages, we will be discussing some of them.</p>
