    <h1 id="title">FDM 3D Printing</h1>
    <p id="firstparagraph">FDM 3d printing is the process of constructing a three dimensional 
        object from a 3d model, this is being done by slowly depositing tiny layers of plastic 
        from a filament spool, such process allows the person owning the printer to design a part
         and print it within a few hours, allowing to produce prototypes of many mechanical/art/robotics 
        designs at some very attractive costs, however- as for everything, a FDM printer has its own set of 
        disadvantages, we will be discussing some of them.</p>
